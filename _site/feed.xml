        <title>Post TEDYouth Empathy Talk Reflections</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orOa-yRL4NI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TEDYouth talk&lt;/a&gt; was recently released online! To my surprise, I was blown away by how incredible and receptive everyone has been of my message. The feedback I have received thus far has been overwhelmingly positive. I spent most of the last two days thanking everybody who watched and reached out with their support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, I decided to select and respond to some feedback I somewhat consistently encountered. This post is by no means an accurate representation of all the types of feedback I received! :) Just a couple of &lt;strong&gt;quick thoughts&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted to jot out. I mean quick when I say it, I spent a portion of writing this while trouble-shooting my site (as evidenced by my grammar). =D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;width--wide&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/tedyouth_stage.jpg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Photo | Ryan Lash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;feedback-a&quot;&gt;Feedback A&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  This talk portrays the men of the Smash community as sexist weirdos.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes! I spent at least a third of the talk covering just how global and dedicated our community is and another third defending gamers. No where did I implicate our entire community as sexist, nor did I imply that only men were capable of being sexist. Actually, I called myself out for once having perpetuated sexist behaviors, and even went as far as calling myself misogynystic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, I am not trying to depict the competitive Smash Brothers community in a bad light. The following two comments on my talk from Sheridan &amp;ldquo;Hyuga&amp;rdquo; Zalewski and Daniel &amp;ldquo;TafoKints&amp;rdquo; Lee sum up the remainder of my thoughts on this subject quite nicely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/sheridan_comment.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Young and younger designers graphic&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/tafo_comment.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Young and younger designers graphic&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;m-b-xxl&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;feedback-b&quot;&gt;Feedback B&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I just wanted to tell you that the talk you gave was incredible / you are a huge inspiration to me c:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/0xA101&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@0xA101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback like this always catches me off-guard. I could have never imagined that &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; I ever did in my life could motivate or inspire another human being. And I assure you, &lt;strong&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; me being insecure&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s me trying to inform you that regardless of whether or not it has ever occurred to you, your actions can potentially motivate others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;twitter__container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t even sum up in a few tweets how it&amp;rsquo;s felt, besides: different. marginalizing. anxiety-producing. maybe even dehumanizing.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; piglet (@drpiggyphd) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drpiggyphd/status/603386171994017792&quot;&gt;May 27, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, you start to realize that you have to keep doing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing because it can and &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; encourage others to take action. One of the many things I hope to see more of in &lt;del&gt;gaming&lt;/del&gt; the world is the act of &lt;strong&gt;women empowering other women&lt;/strong&gt;. We gotta have each other&amp;rsquo;s backs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;twitter__container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m here to stay. I&amp;rsquo;m going balls to the wall. I&amp;rsquo;m hitting it harder. Because it&amp;rsquo;s gonna make it easier for another girl.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; piglet (@drpiggyphd) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/drpiggyphd/status/603387675673001984&quot;&gt;May 27, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@DrPiggyPHD&lt;/strong&gt; hits the nail on the head with her final tweets on the matter. Despite the Smash community not being the most perfect environment for her, she intends on staying if it means helping another girl in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;feedback-c&quot;&gt;Feedback C&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never witnessed any of the women I know suffer from sexism, nor have I seen it happen myself. This is an isolated incident of the Internet just being mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are any parts of my rambling that you should pay close attention to, it&amp;rsquo;s this part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ll recall, I asked that not everyone assume the worst of male gamers/gamers in my talk. I pushed for open dialogues and communication rather than defaulting to shame. These type of conversations hinge on &lt;strong&gt;mutual understanding and empathy&lt;/strong&gt;. They require an open-mind and willingness to listen from &lt;em&gt;both ends&lt;/em&gt; of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So e-friends, when a woman comes forth to speak about sexism she has experienced, I need you to do me a big favor. Take a deep breath. Count to 30. Do you feel that itch of skepticism because you just don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the alleged sexism? &lt;em&gt;Suppress it&lt;/em&gt;, for just a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of jumping to the frequent conclusion that these women are just crying wolf, &lt;strong&gt;ask questions&lt;/strong&gt;. Asking questions shows an eagerness to listen that making statements usually does not. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Hey, I don&amp;rsquo;t really see how this is sexist. Can you please explain?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is at least a better conversation opener than &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;That isn&amp;rsquo;t sexist!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The women I know who come forward usually spend quite some time dwelling on these subjects before ever even &lt;em&gt;considering&lt;/em&gt; going public about them. Whatever you see in their screenshotted evidence or initial few words is usually not the whole story. This is why I find it to be a major &lt;strong&gt;slap in the face&lt;/strong&gt; when someone greets my well-thought-through experiences with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t sexism, people are probably just being mean to you.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Stop making **** up for attention!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Did you do something to elicit these reactions?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Are you sure that&amp;rsquo;s even sexism?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing comments like this usually sparks an uncontrollable anger inside of me, what I would imagine a gamer might feel like if they were to be instantaneously dismissed as a sexist jerk. Do you see where I&amp;rsquo;m going with this? &lt;strong&gt;Dismissive attitudes lead to larger misunderstandings and ultimately, make for one terrible, cyclical, feedback loop&lt;/strong&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ve got to listen to each other!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;feedback-d&quot;&gt;Feedback D&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexism is definitely real, but that is not the only reason women don&amp;rsquo;t play video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I totally agree! What&amp;rsquo;s the problem here? Let&amp;rsquo;s be careful not to get defensive and instead, focus on how we gamers can be even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; welcoming! Eyes on the goal (the Smash community taking over the world)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;feedback-e&quot;&gt;Feedback E&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;people ACTUALLY DON&amp;rsquo;T UNDERSTAND and we&amp;rsquo;re the ones who have to remember to be empathetic in order to be successful at change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a tiny annoyance compared to the end result, but the tiny annoyance still stings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thehollybible&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thehollybible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all the gals out there who sighed just reading this: Yep. I am hesitant to describe this as &amp;ldquo;realistic&amp;rdquo; because that subtly implies that the current reality cannot be improved upon. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll go ahead and just say that this is just the status quo, for &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. However unidealistic it is, I&amp;rsquo;ll cut corners if it means furthering progress!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;feedback-f&quot;&gt;Feedback F&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; to fix this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Throws arms up and clenches fists.&lt;/em&gt; Why, I never thought you&amp;rsquo;d ask! I&amp;rsquo;m so glad you did though, we&amp;rsquo;re finally asking the right questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awareness was and is definitely just the &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; phase of this whole process. It may feel like we&amp;rsquo;ve been through the awareness phase repeatedly, but that&amp;rsquo;s because not everyone is on the same page yet. The last thing we want to do is preach to the choir, amirite? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the answer to this question: &lt;strong&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/strong&gt;. Hear that world? I. Don&amp;rsquo;t. Know. &lt;strong&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s a great idea, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;ve got several ideas floating around in my mind, I am sick and tired of hearing hypotheses flying around about what we &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do. There will definitely be mistakes in our approaches, but that&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of iteration. We need to start acting and worrying less about theory-crafting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m aware of how vague that was but congrats, you just got a peek into my future blog post on this topic. Of course, that one will be far more thought through than this one ^_~.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it! My attention span is getting cut short (blame debugging). Sorry for the disjointed nature of this post! Just wanted to shed some rapid insight.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Advice from a young designer to younger designers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/young-designers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Young and younger designers graphic&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi there. The name’s Lil, and I just left my first design job out of school at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com&quot;&gt;TED&lt;/a&gt; after working there for three and a half years. As a young designer who started her first design job at 21 years old, I spent quite some time flailing around aimlessly before fully understanding the ropes. Luckily, I learned quite a bit and wanted to share with you some of my insight! Here’s to hoping that it spares you from some of the obstacles I faced at my first design job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By the way, a lot of the concepts I discuss in this are on the broader end of the spectrum because specific details are circumstantial based on where you work! Make what you will of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-how-to-talk-about-design-to-non-designers.&quot;&gt;Learn how to talk about design to non-designers.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting non-designers to comprehend and give a shit about design is integral to a designer’s career. You will inevitably need to communicate to non-designers, like clients (duh), about your work and your design decisions. If they fail to understand a design concept, it will be painfully tempting to immediately rant to your designer posse. Trust me, I know how frustrating it can be. These mortals just don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; white space and the need for responsive design, smh (yet they seem to know about the fold all too well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve all done this before, so hypothetically speaking, we should know how unproductive this is. You leave annoyed. The client leaves no less uninformed. The less-than-ideal design remains less-than-ideal. Here’s what you have to realize: &lt;strong&gt;It is not only a designer’s job to create good design, it’s also our responsibility to try and ensure that good design gets implemented.&lt;/strong&gt; This is why the ability to talk to non-designers is such a critical skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you practice this foreign form of communication without making an idiot out of yourself at your first few client pitches? My suggestion: Talk to your friends about design and get them to genuinely care about what you have to say. Make ‘em realize that at the core of strong design lies functionality, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; aesthetic. Being able to do this means that you can explain the rationale behind your design decisions. If you can get your friends to listen and understand this, you’ll be leagues ahead of a younger me when it comes time to interact with a non-designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hold-yourself-accountable-for-ensuring-that-your-skill-set-is-known-to-others.&quot;&gt;Hold yourself accountable for ensuring that your skill set is known to others.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the art school days when you knew everyone and who they were dating? As a result, we all knew which design classmates were more inclined towards photography, illustration, or HTML/CSS. If a project required someone who could code and that someone happened to be you, your classmates or teacher instinctively &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; to flock to you for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work world is not like this. &lt;strong&gt;Nobody is going to know every quirk about you at the start of a new job.&lt;/strong&gt; They will have little to no idea what you are capable of, nor should they be expected to! It’s not their duty to unearth what hidden talents you possess. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; responsibility to inform others. Simply verbalizing this is usually not enough, you need to let your skills shine through your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to showcase these abilities is to find the right opportunities to utilize them. If you’re lucky enough, chances will sprout up in your day to day tasks. Oftentimes the reality is that you need to proactively seek out those moments outside of your normal role. Lend another team a hand or kickstart your own mini-initiative. You’d be surprised how many positive things can come your way because of an adorbz side project you did in your free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;avoid-being-soft-spoken-when-you-start-your-job.&quot;&gt;Avoid being soft-spoken when you start your job.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First impressions are critical at the office. If you paint yourself as soft-spoken from the start, brace yourself to be perceived that way. Remember that pushover friend? Recall when you stopped asking what they wanted for dinner because you knew they wouldn’t care? Yep. Dinner may be whatever, but your career is not (okay, we all love food but just play along here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense why you may be initially nervous to express your opinion, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a new graduate at your first design job. What if you blurt out a barbaric idea in front designers with years of experience over you? Typesetting your resume in Comic Sans might just be more tolerable than suffering the potential humiliation. Better yet, how about Papyrus?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s play this situation out. You’re nervous but you have feedback to contribute. Now what? The trick here is to learn when it is appropriate to interject your thoughts and how to go about doing so. Once you find that sweet spot (which will vary based on your company), make sure to always speak up if you have insightful thoughts. I can assure you that the correct approach will never be to suppress your opinions. &lt;em&gt;Ever&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I am not suggesting that as a new hire that you chime in at every given moment in a meeting full of CEOs. Know your place. Simultaneously, when you do have a strong opinion, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; find a way to express it. &lt;strong&gt;If you fail to speak up, people will do the only logical thing remaining and assume that you don’t have any opinions to contribute.&lt;/strong&gt; This is an unnecessary uphill battle that can easily be avoided if you just use your voice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;define-the-future-of-your-role-through-your-actions.&quot;&gt;Define the future of your role through your actions.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a college design rubric, the parameters of your original job listing are more flexible than you might expect. An employee’s role in a company can be fairly amorphous and evolves in the direction you nudge it toward. Just because the job description online said your main role would be creating banner ads, does not necessarily damn you to a life in pixel-pushing hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep this process moving, it is key to establish your career goals and growth path with your manager. Whether that means infrequent conversations or weekly checkins, you need to ensure that both of your visions align with the direction you want to move toward. Having clashing visions with your manager will slow down your growth. &lt;strong&gt;Speak your needs otherwise they will not be heard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to vocalizing your desire for change, you will need to prove that you&amp;rsquo;re actually improving as a designer. Just because you woke up one day believing that you could redesign your entire company website doesn’t mean you actually can. Let’s say under the 0.01% chance that you are actually equipped to do this (you won’t be), you still have no way of proving this to your manager until the quality of your work speaks to your claims. So get to it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;did-you-learn-anything?&quot;&gt;Did you learn anything?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, you made it to the bottom of my post! Spectacular. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t notice yet, there are two motifs that consistently repeat themselves throughout this post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Produce good work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use your voice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the characteristics I love most about design is that despite many not being aware of its presence, it still carries out its intended function. This parallels the life of a designer a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; too coincidentally. We churn out projects, we make &lt;em&gt;~&amp;#42;things work&amp;#42;~&lt;/em&gt;, but nobody seems to fully understand what it is we exactly do. Designers work from behind-the-scenes and often, our work represents us more than our first and last names do. Sometimes the unfortunate byproduct is that we don’t get enough credit for our trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a young designer, your work can carry you far, but it will be nothing compared to what the power of your voice and work combined can do.&lt;/strong&gt; Create work that you’re proud of, talk about it, and lastly, take ownership of it. It might be challenging if much of your initial work is supplementary to a lead designer&amp;rsquo;s project, but don’t let that hinder your spirit! Practice makes perfect, so keep at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And there you have it, design advice from a young designer to even younger designers. Let me know your thoughts and if this was helpful at all. Spread the love if you think there was any actual coherency in what I had to say &amp;lt;3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Insight into Stream Overlay Creation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I began &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitch.tv/milktea&quot;&gt;streaming&lt;/a&gt; about two months ago due to a fascination with the culture. As a designer and gamer, I was enticed by the idea of critically thinking about design for the sole purpose of streaming video games :D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning of my foray into overlays. Still, I thought it may be helpful for others to explain my thought process behind creating one. I firmly believe that overlays (and most design) require an iterative approach, so don’t be surprised when my overlay changes yet again just days after posting this ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;research:-creepin&amp;#39;&quot;&gt;Research: Creepin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first began with &lt;strong&gt;“research”&lt;/strong&gt;, aka prowling the channels of popular Twitch streamers to see what types of information and language they used in their overlays. Some of the most common categories included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webcam Feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game Capture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent Donor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top Donation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latest Tips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now Playing (Music)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follower Goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sub Goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Media (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After compiling a mental bucket list of these categories, I evaluated which my personal needs required. As a new streamer, I didn&amp;rsquo;t need anything related to donations (or so I thought). I am also not partnered with Twitch, so sub goals were out of the picture. This left me with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Webcam Feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game Capture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follower Goal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now Playing (Music)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wireframing:-drawing-boxes&quot;&gt;Wireframing: Drawing boxes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stop was my sketchbook for wireframing. Despite what few categories I needed initially, I wanted to create a flexible overlay that could be built upon without necessitating a complete facelift. I determined that compartmentalizing these tidbits of information into modules would allow for the most fluidity (my extreme bias towards grids aside).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;width--wide&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/overlay-wireframe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sketched wireframes&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iteration:-failing-a-lot&quot;&gt;Iteration: Failing a lot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I stopped unnecessarily obsessing, I decided to move forward with a three column approach. It wasn’t perfect (yay minimum viable product), but I wanted to begin using it as soon as I could to begin receiving feedback from &lt;strong&gt;viewers&lt;/strong&gt; (aka people watching me play video games). As my friends know, I don’t wear colors so my first overlay predictably followed the same trend (except in this pic, it&amp;rsquo;s old okay).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/overlay-gray.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gray overlay&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only used this overlay maybe twice during evening hours before receiving amusing, critical feedback:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Omg, this is burning my eyes out! I&amp;rsquo;m trying to watch this in a dark room, ahhh!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ha. I would have &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; thought of that. Noted, go darker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, the decision to cut colors also meant I had willingly eliminated a great visual tool for creating hierarchy and contrast. Regardless of what my fashion sense dictated, I wasn’t very happy about that. Back to the drawing board I went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/overlay-color.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Color overlay&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know&lt;/em&gt;, you’re cringing. Don’t worry, so am I. I quickly pumped this out to see if it would help reinforce my “branding” since I use these colors on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lilchen.com&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;. The feedback, of course, was that these colors were blinding. I concur, I totally did not do this color palette justice with my rushed execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/overlay-pink.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Color overlay&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next attempt focused on using color as subtle highlights. The obvious choice was &lt;strong&gt;pink&lt;/strong&gt;, duh (those who know me in real life would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; guess that pink is my favorite color).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a pop of color was a great way to add contrast to my flat-design overlay without crossing over into the world of drop-shadows and gradients. Given the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22840833&quot;&gt;skeuomorphic&lt;/a&gt; approach video games take, I really wanted to &lt;strong&gt;establish an immediate visual difference between the game content and my content&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This overlay was probably the one I stuck with for the longest before realizing that making even a tiny change required editing the image in Photoshop and reuploading a new image entirely. If I didn’t feel like listening to music, there was no easy way of removing that module. The only option would be to leave that spot blank despite the music icon’s presence, which screams &lt;em&gt;“you failed as a designer”&lt;/em&gt; to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My viewers also then began requesting a donation button, which would further require several more pieces of content on my overlay. It was clear that I needed even moar flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;converting-to-code&quot;&gt;Converting to code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It dawned on me one day that because of my gridded approach, this overlay could easily be translated to HTML/CSS! After letting the idea marinate for a bit, I snapped one evening and camped my couch until 8AM coding it (shoutouts to pita chips and popcorn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I ended up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;width--wide&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/overlay-final.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Coded overlay gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire overlay is wrapped inside a &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; sized at &lt;strong&gt;1920 x 1080 pixels&lt;/strong&gt;. It features a three column layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tips section, follower-goal/music/etc. section, and social media section are unordered lists. The chat box, webcam area, and game capture area are styled DIVs. The three headers up top are styled header tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typeface was purchased from &lt;a href=&quot;http://hypefortype.com&quot;&gt;HypeForType&lt;/a&gt; and is being pulled in locally. Something worth noting is that I did have to convert it to .TTF format for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.obsproject.com&quot;&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt; to pick it up for regular text sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The icons are all SVGs which are hosted remotely because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.obsproject.com&quot;&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt; was having issues grabbing these particular files, even with relative paths. You don’t have to use SVGs, but the fact that they appeared fuzzy on my retina display drove me nuts. Yes, fully aware of how obsessive I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/overlay-code-vid.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Coded overlay gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My overall goal in creating an HTML/CSS overlay was to be able to &lt;strong&gt;edit it easily without a dependency on images&lt;/strong&gt;. In the section ahead, I’m going to explain the approaches I took with code. Here’s where things get nerdy so if you aren’t a web-designer, feel free to drop off. Geeks, keep on readin’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;scss&quot;&gt;SCSS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things easier for myself, I used &lt;strong&gt;SCSS&lt;/strong&gt; to define obvious variables, like typeface, highlight-color (the pink), and a few DIV heights. If I want to turn all the pink strokes in my layout orange, I only have to alter &lt;code&gt;$highlight-color&lt;/code&gt; at the top of the .scss file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sass&quot; data-lang=&quot;sass&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// COLORS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;$highlight-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;#ff9d9c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// LAYOUTS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;$block-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;$chat-height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;544&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;oocss&quot;&gt;OOCSS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving onto the info-categories like follower goal, music, tips, and others. Let’s call them &lt;strong&gt;medallions&lt;/strong&gt; since they are small tokens of information. Each section is an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, therefore each medallion is just a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. If I want to remove one, all it takes is commenting out the list item. Likewise, adding one just requires appending a list item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For styling, &lt;code&gt;display: -webkit-flex;&lt;/code&gt; is used to center the icons and text. I then used &lt;strong&gt;object-oriented CSS&lt;/strong&gt; to make each medallion as malleable as possible. Each icon, height, and border is determined by a class. For example, if I want to create the music medallion, all I’d have to type is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;music border h1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By the way, &lt;code&gt;h1&lt;/code&gt; actually refers to “height-1”. Yep, bad choice of class name on my part. But hey, I made this in one night to just test it out! I’ll smooth things over as I make more modular, systematic layouts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if I wanted the notes section without a border, I would type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;note borderless h1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Notes&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pasted a snippet of my these classes below so you get an idea of how I organized them. You’ll notice that the varying heights are defined by multiplying one constant variable. That way, all I have to do is change &lt;code&gt;$block-height&lt;/code&gt; to alter all heights. Either that or I can tweak the multiple specific to the height I want to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-scss&quot; data-lang=&quot;scss&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.follower-goal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;url(/icons/heart-icon.svg)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.music&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;url(/icons/play-icon.svg)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.goal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;url(/icons/banner-icon.svg)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;url(/icons/note-icon.svg)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.tip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;center&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;no-repeat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;url(/icons/sparkle-icon.svg)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.h1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$block-height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.h2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$block-height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.border&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;border-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;solid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;rgba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mh&quot;&gt;#ffffff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;.4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;.borderless&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;border-bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;testing-functionality&quot;&gt;Testing functionality&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using CLR browser plugin, I pulled the overlay seamlessly into OBS. There was just one problem&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/overlay-error.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Sketched wireframes&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird, huh? The overlay clearly works, but fails to load consistently in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.obsproject.com&quot;&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt; upon start. Until I double-click the source and hit “OK” (&lt;em&gt;without even making any other adjustments&lt;/em&gt;), it does not appear 9 out of 10 times. Not a major issue, but who wants to see this lack of preparation at the start of each VOD? I surely don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still chiseling away at this problem with the help of some awesome developer friends. If you think you have a solution to this, I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate a hint! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fin-(for-now)&quot;&gt;Fin (for now)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s where I currently am in this process! I have a lot more plans in the near future which include custom donation alerts, different versions of in-between game overlays, and more. &lt;strong&gt;Do let me know if this peek into my brain was insightful or helpful&lt;/strong&gt;. And please keep in mind that this is not meant to be a tutorial!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a wrap! Catch me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/_lilchen&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for more silliness/nerdiness/obsessiveness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why awareness in the Super Smash Bros. Melee community is vital</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Post:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://milktea-ssbm.tumblr.com/post/76970566292/why-awareness-in-the-super-smash-bros-melee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;milktea-ssbm.tumblr.com/post/76970566292/why-awareness-in-the-super-smash-bros-melee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/blog/gc_controller.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gmoney&amp;#39;s Smashfest&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Super Smash Brothers Melee (SSBM) community kicked off 2013 by raising nearly &lt;a href=&quot;http://shoryuken.com/2013/02/01/fighting-game-fans-raise-over-225000-for-breast-cancer-research-smash-wins/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$100,000 dollars for breast cancer research&lt;/a&gt;, snagging the last coveted spot for the game line-up for EVO in Las Vegas. There, they broke the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/15/4523962/super-smash-bros-melee-evo-2013-livestream-smashes-records&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; for the most watched fighting game, the live-stream peaking at 130,000 viewers. By the end of the year, a Smash Brothers Melee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoUHkRwnRH-KTCH3tJ9WvsWWPEgUu-y6d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; had been released, a piece dedicated to encapsulating the history of a blossoming grassroots community. Throughout the remnants of the year, our community’s leaders cultivated a never-seen-before &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitch.tv/meleeitonme/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;online presence&lt;/a&gt; that helped us grow in unimaginable ways. All these factors served a role in the gaming world witnessing a dying, ten year old game, revitalize itself in what seemed like a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step to maintaining our thriving community is, without debate, to continue expanding and diversifying. This leads us to one of our biggest and undeniable downfalls. If you have attended a tournament, you understand what I am referring to. &lt;em&gt;Where are all the women?&lt;/em&gt; Why are there so few? How can we call ourselves a competitive community that seeks the best competitors if we are alienating a demographic as large as the entire female population? And most importantly, how do we go about fixing this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where awareness becomes vital. The spreading of knowledge regarding the treatment of women in the SSBM community holds the power to nurture our scene into one that is welcoming for all. While there are certainly misogynistic jerks scattered about, a large part of the community is likely perpetuating disrespectful behaviors unknowingly. Not every person who has ever offended a female player does it intentionally, torches ablaze, pitchforks out, mentally chanting, &lt;em&gt;“I’M BEING A SEXIST JERK RIGHT NOW AND IT FEELS SPLENDID!”&lt;/em&gt; The fact that awareness is a constant work in progress is one that we forget, but it is so integral for change. Awareness is not a magical cure that will produce results overnight. It takes time, but with time comes gradual improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you roll your eyes, close the tab, and dismiss this as yet another article stereotyping male gamers as sexist, let us review one more aspect that is often overlooked. &lt;em&gt;Many female players also perpetuate these sexist, disrespectful behaviors&lt;/em&gt; (just ask 17 year old Milktea). This post is not attempting to wage war against male players, or anyone at all. Pointing fingers only causes more defensive barriers to be erected, further inhibiting progress. It is absolutely critical to realize that reforming the competitive SSBM culture is a task that we will all need to tackle in unison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let us begin debunking girl-gamer myths together for the sake of aforementioned awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;girls-who-play-video-games-are-doing-it-for-the-attention.&quot;&gt;Girls who play video games are doing it for the attention.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than traveling down the usual route of debating over whether or not female gamers are playing solely for attention, let’s approach from a different angle. Why is it not possible to enjoy both gaming and attention simultaneously? There are plenty of male players that openly adore being in the spotlight but still take their gameplay seriously. Their dedication is never questioned, nor are they followed around by a group of skeptics doubting their every action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of animosity is directed at female gamers when they receive disproportionately large amounts of attention compared to their male counterparts. But, attention is a two-way street. It needs to be given in order to be received. Players who provide said attention are just as much a part of the equation. In actuality, the core issue actually has nothing to do with attention, but instead, equality. Treating female gamers the way you would treat males ones will fix this imbalance. If a male gamer does not garner this much attention for his actions, then neither should a female gamer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-is-she-a-real-gamer?-prove-it,-pls.&quot;&gt;But is she a REAL gamer? Prove it, pls.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of testing all new male competitors to ensure their legitimacy as real gamers sounds ridiculous, right? So why do we subject all female gamers to this? The act of hazing all female gamers upon entry is toxic. Aside from its elitist undertones, it essentially thwarts any chance of further engagement and potential interest in our community. Poisonous attitudes like this do not make our scene inviting, and if anything, deter its future expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does “real gamer” even mean? What qualifications need to be met to be considered an authentic one? The varying degrees of what being a gamer entails are infinite. Do you think that all one hundred and thirty thousand viewers on EVO’s live-stream attend tournaments? Likewise, does every person who attends tournaments compete? Does every competitor enter expecting to win? There are many aspects to a competitive gaming community aside from the competition itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;just-get-really-good,-then-you’ll-get-some-respect.&quot;&gt;Just get really good, then you’ll get some respect.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since when did you have to become absurdly skilled in order to escape disrespect? Everyone, regardless of their skill level, is entitled to at least basic amounts of respect! High skill levels demand respect in relation to gameplay. But, there are many components to a competitive gaming community aside from its competitive edge. Commentators, streamers, tournament hosts, social network gurus and more constitute the social aspect of our community, contributing just as much to the hype as top players do. It should not come as a shock to anyone that many, if not most, of our players admit to playing on behalf of the great community. The idea that skill level at Smash Bros. is the best way to measure someone’s worth to our community is a dangerous belief, not only to female gamers, but male ones as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;just-deal-with-it.&quot;&gt;Just deal with it.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women who join the Smash Bros. Melee community are inherently disadvantaged from the get-go. It has nothing to do with their actions. Their individuality is completely neglected, actually. Females are immediately branded with negative girl-gamer stigmas simply because of their gender alone. As if this is not enough of a burden, they are then expected to overcome arbitrary hurdles just to earn the basic level of respect that random male gamers intrinsically have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are some women who have endured this negativity for years, that does NOT justify this type of behavior. I applaud the women who have put up with such adversity, good for them. But does that mean that every female who joins our scene should have to deal with this hostility? Does it change the fact that our current attitude will still discourage potential newcomers? The approach of “deal with it” will not alter the status quo, so unless stagnancy is what we are aiming for, we need to move past this mindset. It is not the responsibility of female gamers to endure this bullshit in order to be a part of the community. It is our responsibility to provide a healthy environment that they willingly want to engage with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-complain?-you-get-so-much-attention,-everyone-thinks-you’re-really-hot,-and-they-are-super-nice-to-you!-this-is-female-privilege.&quot;&gt;Why complain? You get so much attention, everyone thinks you’re really hot, and they are super nice to you! This is female privilege.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easily the most deceptive side to the issue of sexism in gaming. The misleading nature of this subject reaffirms my belief that some players are unintentionally perpetuating sexist behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constantly receiving compliments on our appearance, being dramatically sandbagged against so that we have an advantage, and being coddled like a recently-born kitten are some of the “nice&amp;quot; perks women have. Female privilege, mirite? Here’s the catch, the underlying problem has nothing to do with the perceived kindness of these acts. The issue lies within the distinct lack of equality behind these actions. Are these behaviors something you would subject a male player to? Would you fail to see past their physical appearance? Would you severely handicap yourself in a match against them assuming they could not handle the match outcome? Would you feel the obligation to babysit them, as if they were incapable of grasping the gameplay for themselves? These are just a few examples, but the answer still remains: no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not privileges. They are a form of “reverse-sexism” (see ambivalent sexism). “Reverse-sexism” is sneaky and deceitful. On the surface, these kind actions appear to harbor good intentions and often, people honestly believe that they do. Instead, they underhandedly reinforce condescending views of women. Whether the implications are that female gamers need special assistance and handicaps or that their only role is to serve as eye-candy, these behaviors are damaging to our community’s attitude and perception of women. Even if these actions are genuinely not meant to be patronizing, they are by nature. The best thing we can do to prevent these behaviors is to treat female gamers the way we would male ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I truly believe in the Super Smash Brothers Melee community’s ability to make large strides regarding female gaming issues. Armed with awareness and a touch of empathy, I am confident that we will begin to witness uninformed behaviors turn into knowledgeable ones. The SSBM scene is at such a dynamic stage in its life, one brimming with both reevaluation and reform. Now is the time to open our arms wider than ever to invite the world to experience our scene at large. I hope that one day our skewed gender ratio will balance itself. Perhaps, with more women in our community, we will even discover a handful of pro female Smashers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spreading awareness about this issue is the first step. What is the second? I am not entirely sure myself, which is why I would love to open this issue to discussion. How can we, the Super Smash Bros. Melee community, make this a reality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Please do not interpret this post as, “BE EXTRA NICE TO THE LADIES WITH CHERRIES ON TOP.” Many articles on this subject get misconstrued for demanding that everyone be nicer to female gamers simply for the sake of being nicer. That would contradict the very idea of equality. I cannot be more blunt: &lt;strong&gt;treat female Smash players with the same amount of respect you would treat male ones&lt;/strong&gt;. Do not treat them like mythical creatures. Do not treat them like physical manifestations of our community’s problems either.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Special shoutout to friend and old school CT Smasher &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamstunna.tumblr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jam Stunna&lt;/a&gt; for encouraging me to start writing about my concerns on these issues. He also gets credit for helping me edit my terribad grammar.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
